Revision history for Test-StubGenerator

0.9.3   August 8, 2007
        Forgot that the order of each %hash was different for older
        perls, so converted each %self->{structure}->{methods} to use
        a for loop so i could sort the output.

0.9.2   August 7, 2007
        Forgot to update the tests for the change of the name of the
        perltidyrc option.  Also forgot to update this file, but who's
        counting?

0.9.1   August 7, 2007
        Uploaded to CPAN, many tests failed, realized I needed an option
        for a user configurable perltidyrc, so added pertidyrc as an option,
        defaulting to ~/.perltidyrc.

0.9.0   August 1, 2007
        First version checked into repository.
