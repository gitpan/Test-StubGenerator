Revision history for Test-StubGenerator

0.9.1   August 7, 2007
        Uploaded to CPAN, many tests failed, realized I needed an option
        for a user configurable perltidyrc, so added pertidyrc as an option,
        defaulting to ~/.perltidyrc.

0.9.0   August 1, 2007
        First version checked into repository.
